For example, although a user only appeared on 1st and 7th day in the 7-day observation window, it's necessary that days in between still have data since it provides context for the model to learn. Regarding this, a function is presented to add missing days to current data. Note that, to eliminate ambiguity in *first_act_hour* and *last_act_hour*, if a user was not active, these two fields will be filled with -1 instead of 0."

    "The Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is a refined neural network system derived from the Reccurent Neural Network (RNN) to solve the exploding or vanishing gradients problems. This ability to learn from long-term sequences enables LSTM to be very helpful and gain popularity in different fields. It is used to be considered one of the most advanced model to process temporal sequences. For this reaason, we would like to choose a simple LSTM model composed of only an LSTM layer and a Full-Connected layer as our baseline model, predicting the target variable only through time series data without users' profile. This sets the foundation for testing how future enhancements such as adding complexity and user profile embedding can help us achieve higher performance. Below is the baseline LSTM structure."

    "From the result above, our baseline LSTM model which contains only an LSTM processing layer and a Full Connect linear transformation layer, can achieve 66.5% accuracy on the test set and 67.5% accuracy on the training set after 20 epochs. Considering the proportion of positives in our dataset is 48%, the accuracy of all-negative guessing will be 52%. This indicates even a very simple LSTM model starts to learn from sequential input of user time series, having a 14.5 percentage points improvement on accuracy than all-negative guessing.\n",

    "In the traditional machine learning, one long-existing problem is how to encode categorical variable with very high cardinality. One-hot encoding usually is best practice for low cardinality variables, however it will produce a sparse feature matirx when there are too many different categories. To solve this problem efficiently while still perserving as much information carried as possible, people turn to use target statistics to represent these variables. The core idea of target encoding is to map distinct values of a high-cardinality independent variable to an estimate of the probability or the expected value of the dependent attribute. However, the introduction of target variable is likely to cause \"target-leakage\" which provokes overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the deep learning, this problem now receives a satisfactory solution through Embedding. By taking advantage of the ability to automatic learn from losses, an Embedding layer in the model ends up as a lookup table of vectorized representation of different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the variable from user demographics, *province* can be the variable worth going through Embedding, while other numeric variables will be concatenated to vector representation of *province* and the last hidden state from LSTM. For this reason, it is also necessary to have an activation unit before the final Full Connect layer that produces result to capture non-linear relationship."
